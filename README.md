# WaxMoth
WaxMoth is an ADS-B aggregator for parsing multiple different data streams.
Like the [Greater Wax Moth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galleria_mellonella),
it's hearing is second to none as it is able to take in multiple sources of
data to infer the larger ADS-B picture.

This is a custom solution to easily merge several near by ADS-B receivers into a
single display. It is currently very much a Work In Progress
